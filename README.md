# True Drive

## Description
True Drive is a storage solution that allows you to encrypt any file to a noise video and upload it to YouTube. This way, you can store your files securely and access them from anywhere with an internet connection. You can also download and decrypt the noise videos back to your original files whenever you need them.

The project uses a custom encryption algorithm that converts any file into a series of random pixels and sound waves. The encrypted file is then uploaded to YouTube as a private video that only you can see. To retrieve your file, you simply download the video and run it through the decryption algorithm. True Drive is a simple and innovative way to store your files online without compromising your privacy or security.
